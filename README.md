# Week 5: I/O Programming

Welcome to **Week 5** of our Java learning journey. This week focused on advanced I/O programming in Java, particularly handling structured data formats like CSV and JSON, along with exploring annotations, reflection, and key design principles.

## Overview

This week deepened our understanding of Java I/O by working with real-world data formats such as CSV and JSON. We also explored how Java supports metadata with annotations and how reflection can be used to examine or modify program behavior at runtime. Finally, we touched on object-oriented design principles to write cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Topics Covered

### 01: CSV Data Handling
- Reading from and writing to CSV files
- Parsing CSV content using `String.split()` and libraries like OpenCSV
- Storing and manipulating tabular data
- Best practices for CSV file processing

### 02: JSON Data
- Introduction to JSON format
- Parsing JSON using libraries such as `org.json`, Gson, or Jackson
- Creating JSON objects from Java classes (serialization)
- Converting JSON to Java objects (deserialization)

### 03: Annotations, Reflection, and Design Principles
- Built-in and custom annotations in Java
- Runtime processing with reflection (`Class`, `Method`, `Field`)
- Use cases of annotations in frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Spring)
- Introduction to key software design principles:
  - SOLID principles
  - Separation of concerns
  - Code reusability and maintainability

## How to Use This Repository

Each topic is organized into separate folders. Within them, you'll find:
- Sample Java programs for CSV/JSON handling
- Practice exercises
- Notes and explanations for annotations and reflection
- Design principle examples

Explore, run, and tweak the code to solidify your understanding.
